# Stock Price Predictor (WIP)

## Project Overview
The stock price predictor is a personal project aimed at applying data science and machine learning concepts to forecast stock trends. The goal is to build a Python-based tool that takes real-time historical data, processes it, and generates predictive insights.  

While this project is still a work in progress, it has already been a major learning opportunity, combining curiosity, self-learning, and experimentation.  

## Why This Project?
I wanted to bridge the gap between abstract machine learning concepts and real-world application. Financial markets offered a fascinating, data-rich problem space to explore. The stock market also provided a personal motivation: I’ve always wondered if you could use code to find patterns or signals in the chaos of market data, even if it's not 100% accurate.  

## How to Run
Coming soon – will include setup instructions once the first working version is ready.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **yfinance** – fetch stock market data  
- **pandas & numpy** – data cleaning and manipulation  
- **matplotlib** – visualizations and trend exploration  
- **scikit-learn** – basic ML models (e.g., linear regression)  
- *Future scope:* PyTorch or TensorFlow for LSTM-based deep learning models  

## Learning Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing and handling real-time data  
- Build and evaluate predictive models  
- Improve debugging and code structuring practices  
- Explore advanced ML models (like LSTMs)  
- Potentially build a UI/dashboard for interactivity  

## Project Timeline & Milestones
- Setup and fetch stock data with **yfinance**  
- Clean and preprocess data with **pandas/numpy**  
- Visualize trends with **matplotlib**  
- Build and test regression models (**ongoing**)  
- Explore feature engineering, technical indicators (moving averages, RSI)  
- Evaluate model performance with RMSE and other metrics

Future goals:
- Research and implement **LSTM-based models** for sequence prediction  
- Build a lightweight dashboard/UI (future goal)  

## Reflections & Takeaways
This project has taught me that building something from scratch isn’t about getting everything right the first time. It’s about persistence, experimentation, and learning from each failure.  

I’ve learned how to troubleshoot, read documentation more effectively, and push through when things break. While it’s not polished yet, it represents my growth as a builder and my curiosity as a developer.
